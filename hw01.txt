Part A: Analytical Problems (20 pts)

1)
	a)log2(2) = 1
	b) log2(1024) = 10
	c) log2(1000) = 9.966..Rounded
	d) floor(log2(1000)) = 9
	e) ceiling(log2(1000)) = 10

2) Powers of 2, for example  N has to be 1, 2, 4, 8, 16…
3) Not powers of 2 because the left side is always greater than 1
4) 
	a) a = b
	b) a < b since the statement is True
	c) a > b since the statement is False
	d) a <= b 
	e) a > b since we know that b < b is not True

5)
	a) True, will print 54
	b) Error, can’t use * with double and string
	c) True, will print hi5ttruethere

6)
	a) 2bc
	b) 5bc
	c) 5bc
	d) bc5
	e) bc23

7) Assume that we always go left, then the numbers 2, 12, 25, and 45 will all take three comparisons to find.

8) To find the unsuccessful number 1 it would take at least 3 searches to know that it’s not there.
   To find the unsuccessful number 100 it would take at least 4 searches to know that it’s not there.

   Thus, after three or four searches we will know that a statement won’t be true.

9) 1 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 9 = 24 then divide by 5 =   4.8 average tries.

10) 1 + 3 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 18 then divide by 10 = 1.8 average tries.
