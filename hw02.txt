Part A: Analytical Problems

1) 
	Line 1: the “P” in public should be lower case
	Line 2: In “( x )” it needs to have a type, for example “(int x)” and integer should be int.
	Line 6: needs “}” to close entire function
	Line 7: should be, public static void main(String[] argv) {
	Line 8: unnecessary “{“
	Line 9: needs to be System.out.println(“Hello World!”);
	Line 11: get rid of ) and put } to end the entire program.

4)
	Will print:
	
	2
	2

	4
	5
	6

5)
	A) 1-9
	B) 2-9
	C) 2-9
